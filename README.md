This portfolio contains what I consider to be my best work. It contains projects from university as well as personal projects done in my own time.

## About Me

> Thomas Metcalf
> 18
> Male

I study Game Art at University of Lancashire. I have recently passed my first year and will be moving into second year in September. I primarily work with Autodesk Maya, Adobe Photoshop and Libresprite. In my own time I enjoy games such as Sea of Thieves, Payday 2, Monkey Island and Terraria, and I do some light game development from time to time. I am a keen game artist and am always on the lookout for inspiration wherever I go. I have a particular fondness for british steam locomotives, especially those of the 2nd and 4th eras.

A lot of my work is completed in education editions of Autodesk Maya, so I ask that my work is not taken, used or reproduced in any way as the licensing for this product does not allow for commercial use. This includes any work being used in AI models for training or otherwise.
