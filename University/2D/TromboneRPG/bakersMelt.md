# Baker's Melt

The Baker's Melt is a Mad Max inspired trombone with transformational abilities allowing it to be a powerful RPG, a speedy hoverboard and more. My brief for this project was 'transformational weapon', and I inspired the piece heavily from my soprano trombone, as well as some motorbike engine parts.

Before 'The Fall', an apocolyptic like event that killed most living organisms, The Baker was well known for his pastry, The Melt. In light of this, his pride and joy, his trombone, was repurposed as a weapon and vehicle, with capablility to be even more, still retaining the ability to play tunes, bringing little joy to those who were left.
