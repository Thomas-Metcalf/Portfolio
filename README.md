## About Me

> Thomas Metcalf

> 18

> Male

I study Game Art in first year at University of Lancashire. I primarily work with Autodesk Maya, Adobe Photoshop and Libresprite. In my own time I enjoy games such as Sea of Thieves, Payday 2, Monkey Island and Terraria, and I do some light game development from time to time. I am a keen game artist and am always on the lookout for inspiration wherever I go. I have a particular fondness for british steam locomotives, I am play Soprano Cornet for a brass band, and enjoy camping.

## How this works

Each project has it's own folder, which contains a .md file. This file contains screenshots and a description of the project.
